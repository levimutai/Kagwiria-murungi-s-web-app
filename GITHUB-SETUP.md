# 🚀 Push to GitHub Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `kagwiria-website`
4. Description: `Kagwiria's Digital Journey - Complete website for her 47 counties motorcycle adventure across Kenya`
5. Make it **Public**
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kagwiria-website.git`

Copy this URL.

## Step 3: Run These Commands
Open terminal in the `C:\kagwiria-website` folder and run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kagwiria-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 4: Verify
Go back to GitHub and refresh - you should see all the website files uploaded!
